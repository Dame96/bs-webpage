# bs-webpage

Hi Team Welcome back to my repo! 

Project Title:
bs-webpage (My Bootstrap Webpage)

Description: 
For this project the objective was to develop a web page using the new bootstrap concepts that were covered in the recent module. Applying the acquired knowledege I implemented the form, table, navbar and images using bootstraps utility classes and components to create a responsve modern layout! 

Dependencies: For this project I utilized bootstraps CDN to import the functionality into my webpage. 

Enjoy the cool pictures and try re-sizing the page to see the responsive features and how the elements stack!
